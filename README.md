## Introduction
This project focuses on predicting graduate admission outcomes for students in Dhaka, Bangladesh, based on a dataset of 400 student records from Yocket. The project uses machine learning models to predict admission chances and interpret the factors affecting these decisions through explainable AI.

## Goals of the Project
- Achieve high accuracy in admission predictions.
- Provide transparency and interpretability using LIME.
- Ensure fairness in model predictions across different demographics.

## Key Problems Addressed
- Lack of comprehensive datasets for graduate admissions in Bangladesh.
- Need for model interpretability to explain predictions.
- Mitigating biases in model predictions.

## Project Setup
